# How to install

- Download or clone the repository.
- Connect your VS Code to your developer org.
- Deploy the source using the manifest in package.xml.
- Login in the org and add the Project and Milestones Permission Set to a user using Standard User profile.


# How to use

- Login as the Standard User.
- A new tab should be available in your app launcher: "Project Assistant Creator".
- Open it and you will see a LWC that has input fields for you to create a project and add as many milestones and to-do's tasks you want.
- To review the created project, in app launcher, look for "Project". The Milestones should be available in the related tab. For the To-Do, it was used the standard object "Task". The tasks should be in the related tab of the milestone. Just mark it as complete and it should update the completion of the milestone (you may need to update the page to see).
